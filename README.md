NEW UPDATE ON MY GAME
I've enhanced my snake game by incorporating exciting new features and functionalities. The repository showcases a revamped user experience, featuring a dynamic main menu that welcomes players with an engaging interface. Additionally, an options menu has been seamlessly integrated, enabling players to finely adjust volume levels and sound effects to their liking.

One of the key highlights is the infusion of fresh visual designs and captivating animations for the game's main character. This transformation breathes new life into the gameplay, offering players an enhanced sense of involvement and enjoyment. Everyone can now explore the repository to witness the evolution of the snake game and enjoy an even more enthralling gaming experience. :)
